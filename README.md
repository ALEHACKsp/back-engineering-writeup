# An introduction to game hacking

So, you would like to become a game hacker;  But you are found asking yourself, "where do I begin?"  I hope I can provide an answer to your question, and to other questions that you may have.  In my series, I explain how to manipulate and reverse engineer game engines, as well as touch on specific game engines such as the Unity and Unreal Engine.  I provide basic examples of game cheats, such as Rust, to demonstrate the general structure of a game hack as well as guide you to making your own.  Furthermore, I also provide tutorials on using various different tools such as reclass and cheat engine to help in the revese engineering of the game.
