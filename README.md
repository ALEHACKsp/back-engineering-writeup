# An introduction to game hacking

## Preface
So, you would like to become a game hacker;  But you are found asking yourself, "where do I begin?"  I hope I can provide an answer to your question, and to other questions that you may have.  In my series, I explain how to manipulate and reverse engineer game engines, as well as touch on specific game engines such as the Unity and Unreal Engine.  I provide basic examples of game cheats, such as Rust, to demonstrate the general structure of a game hack as well as guide you to making your own.  Furthermore, I also provide tutorials on using various different tools such as reclass, cheat engine, and ida to help in the revese engineering of the game.

## Prerequisites
To understand my series to its fullest extent, you should have a basic comprehension of assembly and c++ as well as a basic understanding of memory.

## The Basics
In this segment of the series, I will explain how to use tools such as reclass, cheat engine, and ida.

### Reclass
Reclass is a powerful tool used to view structs in memory as well as construct them.
